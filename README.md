# Mockstrap

A CSS framework that looks terrible so that you can focus on building apps that *work*, instead of pixel-perfection.

[Example page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcrowe/mockstrap/master/example.html)

Borrows the layout system from [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/layout/container).

## Usage

Include `mockstrap.css` in your html.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./path/mockstrap.css">
```

## Development

You can build the CSS using `make build`.
